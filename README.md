# beyond-chats-monorepo

Monorepo scaffold for the Beyond Chats project.

Phases:

- Phase 1: `laravel-backend` (article scraping backend)
- Phase 2: `node-automation` (Node scrapers)
- Phase 3: `react-frontend` (React + Vite frontend)

Setup:

- Each subproject has its own README with setup steps.
- Run `npm install` in `node-automation` and `react-frontend`.
- To use the PHP backend fully, install Composer and run `composer install` inside `laravel-backend` if you convert it to a full Laravel app.
