# laravel-backend

Phase 1 backend (Laravel-style stubs)

Setup:

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and adjust env values.
- This is a minimal scaffold. To use a full Laravel install, run `composer create-project laravel/laravel .` then merge these files.

Commands:

- `php artisan` (if Laravel is installed)
- `php artisan migrate` to run migrations
